Start a brainstorming session to explore design options and clarify requirements.

Use the brainstorm skill to guide the discussion through structured design exploration:
- Clarify requirements via Socratic questioning
- Generate and evaluate alternative approaches
- Make justified design decisions
- Persist decisions via handoff for the planning phase

Recommended for:
- Exploring feature requirements
- Evaluating multiple implementation approaches
- Clarifying vague requirements before planning
- Making technical design decisions

After brainstorming, use `/create-plan` to create detailed implementation plan.
